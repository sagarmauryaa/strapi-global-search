Spotlight-style **global search** for the Strapi v5 admin: every collection type and single type, from a dedicated page or a <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> palette.

Install it, enable it, and start Strapi. It introspects your content types at boot and never needs to know your schema ahead of time.

> Add a screenshot or short GIF of the palette here (`docs/palette.png`) once you have one.

**Strapi 4:** use [`strapi-global-search@1.x`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/strapi-global-search/v/1.0.0). This major (`2.x`) is Strapi 5 only.

## Features

- **Searches everything** — every `api::` collection type *and* single type, including text fields nested inside components.
- **Two surfaces** — a full search page under the plugins menu, and a command palette available from anywhere in the admin.
- **Predictable ordering** — results are ranked id → name → other fields → nested fields (see below), never by an opaque relevance score.
- **Respects your permissions** — an editor only ever sees content types they can read in the Content Manager.
- **i18n and draft/publish aware** — searches every locale by default and finds drafts.
- **No index, no extra services** — plain database queries, nothing to keep in sync.

## Installation

```bash
npm install strapi-global-search
# or
yarn add strapi-global-search
```

Enable it in `config/plugins.js` or `config/plugins.ts`:

```js
module.exports = {
  'global-search': {
    enabled: true,
  },
};
```

Then start your Strapi app (`npm run develop`). There is no extra build step for this package.

This package has **no** `preinstall` / `install` / `postinstall` scripts and does not use git or remote URL dependencies. On [npm v12](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-07-08-npm-install-time-security-and-gat-bypass2fa-deprecation/) you do not need an `allowScripts` entry for `strapi-global-search`.

## Result ordering

| Priority | Match |
|---|---|
| 1 | `id` / `documentId` exact |
| 2 | `id` / `documentId` partial |
| 3 | Name (the Content Manager main field) exact |
| 4 | Name starts with the query |
| 5 | Name contains the query |
| 6 | Any other top-level text field |
| 7 | Any text field inside a component |

Ties break on an exact-case match, then the shortest matching value, then the most recently updated entry.

## Configuration

Everything is optional and can be changed at **Settings → Global Search → Configuration**, or pinned in `config/plugins.js` / `config/plugins.ts`:

```js
module.exports = {
  'global-search': {
    enabled: true,
    config: {
      minChars: 2,             // minimum query length
      debounce: 250,           // ms to wait after the last keystroke
      perTypeLimit: 20,        // rows fetched per content type
      maxResults: 100,         // cap on the merged, ranked result set
      deep: true,              // search inside components
      maxDepth: 3,             // how many component levels to walk
      includeDrafts: true,     // include unpublished entries
      queryTimeout: 4000,      // per-content-type timeout in ms
      concurrency: 8,          // content types queried in parallel
      excludedContentTypes: [],// e.g. ['api::log.log']
      excludedFields: [],      // e.g. ['api::article.article:body']
      displayFields: {},       // extra fields in the result row, keyed by UID
    },
  },
};
```

## Permissions

Two RBAC actions are registered and can be assigned per role:

- `plugin::global-search.read` — use the search page and the palette.
- `plugin::global-search.settings` — change the configuration.

Search results are additionally filtered by each user's Content Manager read permissions.

## Performance notes

Searching runs live database `LIKE` queries — there is no index to maintain, but a query on a very large table is only as fast as your database makes it. The plugin keeps this bounded with a per-content-type row limit, a bounded column projection, a per-type timeout, a concurrency cap and a client-side debounce. For very large tables, consider a database index on the fields people actually search, or disable those content types in Settings.

Reported result counts reflect the capped set (`perTypeLimit` rows per type, `maxResults` overall) — a `+` in the UI means there were more matches than were fetched.

## Limitations

- **Dynamic zones** and **blocks** fields are not searched: the query engine cannot filter polymorphic JSON columns.
- Relations, media and JSON fields are not searched.
- Only `api::` content types are searched — not plugin content types such as users-permissions users or uploaded files.
